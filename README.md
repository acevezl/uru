# URU

"Today you are you, that is truer than true. There is no one alive, that is youer than you." ~ Dr. Seuss

## Description:

URU is an economic and social empowerment application that builds a connection between child and behavior therapist.

One of the most familiar challenge a Behavior Therapist encounter is that they do not have time to perform proper assessment of the patient they will work with.
Agencies or employers usually assigns a therapist without proper knowledge about a child with developmental disability.
URU improves the functionality of a dating app. It establishes initial connections between the parent and the behavior therapist and then the child.

With the robust data that URU is able to collect from these entities, it will be easier for Behavior Therapists to have a clear match with their patient and therefore
effectively provide optimal services to the child with Applied Behavior Therapy needs.

## Motivation for development

## User story:
